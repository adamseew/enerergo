# Ergodic controllers

This repository contains **energy-aware**, time-optimal, and pure ergodic controllers.

It constitutes the supplementary material to the paper "Energy-aware ergodic search: Continuous
long-term exploration for multiagent systems", which is currently in preparation.

## MATLAB

To run the MATLAB (R) implementation, simply run
```bash
matlab -nodesktop -r "run MAIN"
```
in bash. The script depends on [CasADi framework](https://web.casadi.org/get/). You can specify its location by changing the value of the variable `CASADI_PATH`.
